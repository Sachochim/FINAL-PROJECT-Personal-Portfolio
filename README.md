# Samantha Lapeña — Personal Portfolio (Final Project)

**Course:** IT Elective 3  
**Stack:** HTML5, CSS3 (Bootstrap 5 + custom CSS), JavaScript, Git & GitHub

## Project Overview
This repo contains a fully responsive personal portfolio website that acts as a digital resume and showcases projects, skills and contact info. Built with semantic HTML5, Bootstrap 5 (CDN), and a custom `style.css` overriding the default Bootstrap look to provide an aesthetic, glassy design.

## Files
- `index.html` — Main single-page layout with semantic sections (hero, about, skills, projects, contact)
- `style.css` — Custom styles and CSS variables
- `script.js` — Small JavaScript for smooth scrolling & minor UX
- `README.md` — This file

## How to Customize
1. Replace the placeholder images in `index.html` with your own photos/screenshots.
2. Modify the profile text, contact email, and links (GitHub, LinkedIn).
3. Update project cards with real project URLs and repo links.
4. Replace Formspree endpoint in the contact form (`action="https://formspree.io/f/your-form-id"`) with your own Formspree form ID or another form handler.

## Deployment (GitHub Pages)
1. Create a new public repository on GitHub (e.g., `portfolio`).
2. Clone locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/portfolio.git
